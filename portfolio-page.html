    <p>Very passionate about tech currently doing a prep course at Moringa School.
      I didn't have any experience in IT prior to joining Moringa School but after two days learning
      I've been able to learn basic HTML and CSS to be able to write this portfolio page.</p>
    <p>I decided to take a class on Programming firstly because I'm passionate about tech even
       though I'm in the engineering field but also because there's a lot of technology being intergrated into cars</p>
